      <p class="section-body">
        This project was completed as part of VIS 41 and focused on designing a series of posters based on something meaningful to you. The goal was to explore visual hierarchy, typography, and composition while communicating a clear concept. Over the course of the project, I developed multiple concepts and refined my designs through critique and iteration, resulting in a set of posters that explore the theme of balance.

      <p class="section-title">Themes & Concepts</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        For this project, I chose the theme of <strong>balance</strong>. The idea of 
        balance is something I constantly try and apply in my life. To me, the idea of balance 
        is not about perfect symmetry, rather it's the ongoing effort to hold space 
        for two seemingly opposite forces&mdash;work and rest, ambition and acceptance,
        solitude and connection. The challenge lies in giving space to each, without 
        letting one dominate the rest.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p class="section-body">      
        This theme guided the overall direction of the posters, influencing the 
        mood and visual language of the designs. Additionally, I was influenced 
        by a couple of sub-themes, such as <strong>sound, nature, and peace,</strong> that guided some of 
        the core elements of my posters. I aimed to create work that 
        felt thoughtful and dynamic, while still maintaining clarity and strong 
        visual hierarchy.

            Over several weeks, we completed different stages of the poster-making
            process, including image-making, denotative poster design, connotative 
            poster design, and the final exhibition poster. Each week, we presented
            our work to the class and received critiques that helped refine our designs.

          <p class="section-title">Design Constraints & Criteria</p>
          <p class="section-body">
            The project included several design constraints that guided my work.
            Each poster needed to clearly communicate its concept while adhering
            to the main components of visual hierarchy: size and scale, color and
            contrast, spacing and proximity, negative space, and alignment.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p class="section-body">
            For the final exhibition poster, additional criteria required the inclusion 
            of key event information, such as names, dates, and locations, while maintaining
             a visually engaging and organized layout. These constraints encouraged 
            thoughtful decision-making and careful attention to clarity, readability, and composition.

    <div class="section">
      <p class="section-title">Ideation Process</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        I began the ideation process by brainstorming concepts and images that were
        personally meaningful to me. From there, I coalesced the ideas within the images 
        into 6 potential themes: <strong>sound, chaos, deliberation, peace, balance, 
        false dichotomy</strong>. I experimented with different image making techniques, 
        such as photography, digital-drawing, audio visualizers, and more to create 
        a collage of images that encapsulated my theme.

            As I continued through the poster making process, I was mainly drawn towards
            two image-making techniques, that I believed best encapsulated the key qualities
            and themes which I desired in my posters.
            <br /><br />
            The first technique I used was <strong>using computer systems to visualize 
            audio</strong> through graphs, 3D models, abstract forms, etc.
            I chose to create the visuals from one of my favorite songs 
            "two bad" by 2hollis. I would periodically screenshot the visuals, 
            capturing varying forms of the song. 
            <br/><br/>
            The second technique I used was to tweak the colors, saturation, and
            applying filters to pictures of nature that I took.

        Beyond finding inspiration for the posters and creating the images
        that would go along with them, I also spent a lot of time working 
        on the content of the posters. Each week, I created iterations of my 
        posters, testing hierarchy, scale, color, and spacing. Feedback from
        class critiques helped me refine my designs and make deliberate choices
        that enhanced clarity and impact.

        Typography, color, and composition were used to create a strong
        visual hierarchy and guide the viewer through the information. Scale, contrast,

        of the posters. 
        <br/><br/>
        The final exhibition poster incorporates event details such as names, dates,

        overall concept.

        If I were to continue developing this project, I would explore different
        image making techniques and visual formats in search of a new and perhaps
        better way of expressing the theme. This project helped me better understand
        the intricacies of visual hierarchy, iteration, and critique. Moving forward,
        I plan to apply these lessons to create more intentional and cohesive designs.
