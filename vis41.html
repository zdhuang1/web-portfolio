      <p class="section-body">
        This project was completed as part of VIS 41 and focused on designing a series of posters based on something meaningful to you. The goal was to explore visual hierarchy, typography, and composition while communicating a clear concept. Over the course of the project, I developed multiple concepts and refined my designs through critique and iteration, resulting in a set of posters that explore the theme of balance.

      <p class="section-title">Themes & Concepts</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        For this project, I chose the theme of <strong>balance</strong>. The idea of 
        balance is something I contantly try and apply in my life. To me, the idea of balance 
        is not about perfect symmetry, rather it's the ongoing effort to hold space 
        for two seemingly opposite forces&mdash;work and rest, ambition and acceptance,
        solitude and connection. The challenge lies in giving space to each, without 
        letting one dominate the rest.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p class="section-body">      
        This theme guided the overall direction of the posters, influencing the 
        mood and visual language of the desings. Additionally, I was influenced 
        by a couple of subthemes, such as <strong>sound, nature, and peace,</strong> that guided some of 
        the core elements of my posters. I aimed to create work that 
        felt thoughtful and dynamic, while still maintaining clarity and strong 
        visual hierarchy.

            Over several weeks, we completed different stages of the poster-making
            process, including image-making, denotative poster design, connotative 
            poster design, and the final exhibition poster. Each week, we presented
            our work to the class and received critiques that helped refine our designs.

          <p class="section-body">
            The project included several design constraints that guided my work.
            Each poster needed to clearly communicate its concept while adhering
            to the main components of visual hierarchy: size and scale, color and
            contrast, spacing and proximity, negative space, and alignment.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p class="section-body">
            For the final exhibition poster, additional criteria required the inclusion of key event information, such as names, dates, and locations, while maintaining a visually engaging and organized layout. These constraints encouraged thoughtful decision-making and careful attention to clarity, readability, and composition.

      <p class="section-title">Ideation Process</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        I began the ideation process by brainstorming concepts and images that were
        personally meaningful to me. From there, I coalesced the ideas within the images 
        into 6 potential themes: <strong>sound, choas, deliberation, peace, balance, 
        false dichotomy</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        I experiemnted with different image making techniques, such as photograhy, 
        digital-drawing, audio visualizers, and more to create a collage of images 
        that encapsulated my theme. Each week,I created iterations of my posters, 
        testing hierarchy, scale, color, and spacing. Feedback from class criqutes helped me refine my designs and make
        deliberate choices that enhanced clarity and impact.

            The designer explained she was trying to resemble the colors and
            style of a vintage newspaper. But other members argued that the
            colors should be more aligned with the newsletter brand colors -
            purples, blues, and greens. In a survey that our head of outreach
            posted on Instagram, the majority agreed to make the switch to a
            cooler color palette.

        For the final design, we kept some of the features from the initial
        design - such as the navigation bar, most of the navigation labels, and
        the simple subscription form. We also kept the grid layout to display
        past newsletters. <br />
        <br />
        We did change the color scheme to a combination of purples and blues,
        which better matched our other brand and social media materials. We
        added an additional page for events and moved the subscription form to
        the home page.
        <br />
        <br />
        The website was built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form posts the
        submitted emails to a google sheets, using a custom API built using the
        platform SheetDb. The website is deployed through Vercel.
