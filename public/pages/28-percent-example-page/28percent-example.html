        Building a website for the 28% Women in STEM newsletter funded by the

      <p class="section-body">
        In September of 2020, I started The 28% Women in STEM newsletter with 7
        of my female students from my freshman computer science class. At that
        point, our team was so small and the newsletter was so young - we didn’t
        look for any funding. Three years later, we have grown a lot - we have
        hundreds of subscribers and publish the newsletter both digitally and on
        print. So this year, we sought out funding and applied as a GirlsBuild
        Year 9 Project, granting us $2,000 for printing and operational costs.
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        Part of the requirements of the grant was to build a website. We had
        bought the 28percent.com domain a while ago, but wanted to lower the
        cost of building and maintaining the website as much as possible. So we
        decided to design, build, and maintain it ourselves in HTML/CSS &
        JavaScript!

            On this project, I worked with the head of the layout department and
            the head of the outreach and social media department. Our layout
            head acted as the UX designer, producing mood boards, color schemes,
            and an inital prototype. Our outreach head acted as the UX
            researcher, pushing out surveys and getting feedback through our
            social media platforms.

            I acted as a project manager and developer, keeping track of the
            overarching deadline, approving designs, leading team meetings,
            assigning tasks, and developing a large part of the actual website.

            The grant required us to build a website that described the purpose
            of the project, the team, events, and project deliverables. We also
            needed a way for users to subscribe to the newsletter, find team
            meeting times and locations, and read current and past newsletters.

      <p class="section-body">
        Our layout designer worked on an initial prototype in Figma - working to
        design something that would meet three primary needs: sharing current
        and past newsletters, displaying information about the club, and
        allowing users to subscribe.
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        After going through a couple rounds, she presented this initial design
        to the rest of the team. There was a lot of positive feedback, as well
        as some good constructive points.

          <p class="sbs-right" style="width: 265px">
            A lot of the team liked the simplicity of the navigation menu and
            information architecure, noting it was really easy to find
            everything and navigate through the website. <br /><br />
            Team members also liked the use of a grid layout for past
            newsletters and how simple the subscribe feature was.
            <br /><br />
            But in terms of the color & typography choices, the team was
            divided.

            The designer explained she was trying to resemble the colors and
            style of a vintage newspaper. But other members argued that the
            colors should be more aligned with the newsletter brand colors -
            purples, blues, and greens. In a survey that our head of outreach
            posted on Instagram, the majority agreed to make the switch to a
            cooler color palette.

      <p class="section-title">The Final Design</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        For the final design, we kept some of the features from the initial
        design - such as the navigation bar, most of the navigation labels, and
        the simple subscription form. We also kept the grid layout to display
        past newsletters. <br />
        <br />
        We did change the color scheme to a combination of purples and blues,
        which better matched our other brand and social media materials. We
        added an additional page for events and moved the subscription form to
        the home page.
        <br />
        <br />
        The website was built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form posts the
        submitted emails to a google sheets, using a custom API built using the
        platform SheetDb. The website is deployed through Vercel.
